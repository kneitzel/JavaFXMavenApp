# JavaFX Maven Project

Example Maven Project for a JavaFX Application.

Maven modules are configured so that even Images are build (including JPackage app-image).

Project includes PMD and spotbugs!

**Important**: Using moditect to add module descriptions is not required. New solution to create images through jpackage will be commited soon.
Check branch direct-jpackage to see the current test project I build.
